# Desktop GUI for LG Ultrafine Display Brightness adjustment

`lg-ultrafine-brightness-switcher` is a GUI Application build from [wails](https://wails.app/) to interfaces with the LG UltraFine 4K monitor in order to adjust brightness from Linux.(Because this monitor was designed specifically for Apple computers and thus has no physical buttons. Without the built-in features of macOS, adjusting brightness on this monitor wasn't possible.)

Note: I have tested the UltraFine 4K 23.7" model 24MD4KL. The old 4k 22 inch model or old&new 27 inch 5k models are not tested.
You may need to manually change the Device Id in `go-lguf` library.

## Usage

> Wails does not support building release packages for linux distros yet so you have to manually build this project and run it throuth terminal.

```
// install all dependencies wails need and wails itself.

// cd this project

// build the binary
$wails build
// run application
$sudo build/ultrafine-brightness-slider

```
